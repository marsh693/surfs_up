# Overview of the analysis
    
    The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy analize temperature trends before they open their
surf shop.  Specifically they are looking for the temperature trends for the months of June and
December.  To do this, we were tasked with running two summary queries with Python, Pandas, and SQLalchemy 
to retrieve the summary of weather trends for the two months in question. 

# Results There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December

    After creating and running the two queries for the months of June and December, the summaries gave us information
about the weather trends for the two months.  Though the months seemed similar, there were differences that showed up 
between the months.  
    
    1)The mean temperatures for the months of June and December. Pictures one and two
    in the images folder show the differences of average temperature for the two months. Picture one shows the average
    temperature for June as 74.94 where as picture two shows the average temperature for December as 71.04.

    2)The maximum temperature for the months of June and December. Pictures three and four show the the maximum temperatures for
    the months of June and December. Though they are close to each other, the month of June had a higher max temperature
    at 85 compared to December at 83.

    3)The minimum temperature for June and December. Pictures five and six show the minimum temperatures for the months of 
    June and December.  The month of June had a minimum temperature of 64 whereas December had a minimum temperature of 56.
    Though the two months were earily close in maximum temperatures this was not the same for minimum temperatures.


# Summary

    After completeing the two summaries it is safe to say that the business for the ice cream and surf shop would be
suitable year round. Though the months did have their differences, it is safe to assume the biggest difference of minimum
temperature can attest to the temperatures at night compared to the maximum temperatures which could be during peak business hours.
Two additional queries that can be run to help determine if business would be suitable year round is checking the months of June and 
December for the number of rainy days for the months.  This will give us another insight to days that may not bring in as much
business as the sunny days.  On the other side of the previous query we can run a summary for statistics of the number 
of sunny days. This will give us insight to the days that would possibly bring in more business compared to rainy days that 
may bring in less business.
